		Welcome to <i>Breathe2Relax</i>!
	</h2>

	<p>
		We've all heard the words "take a deep breath" when someone who cares
		about us wants to help us calm down. And we all know how good it feels
		to take a really deep breath when we're agitated or upset. With
		Breathe2Relax
		<!--<sup class="Registered">&#0153;</sup>-->
		, you've got a portable tool you can use to learn how to breathe
		deeply and reduce stress whenever you need to. Because you can access
		Breathe2Relax via your mobile phone, you'll always have Breathe2Relax
		handy when you need it most.
	</p>

	<p>To get started, here's some quick info on each of the sections
		in this application:</p>

	<h2 class="header">Step 1: LEARN</h2>

	<p>The LEARN section is a great place to start. Here you'll gain
		useful knowledge about your body's stress response, and you'll come to
		understand why deep breathing is so beneficial.</p>

	<h2 class="header">Step 2: WATCH</h2>

	<p>
		In the WATCH section, you'll learn the difference between shallow
		chest breathing and deeper, more calming <i>diaphragmatic</i> or <i>belly
			breathing</i>. You'll see how to use your body's primary breathing
		muscle, the diaphragm, to draw air deeply into your lungs. This is a
		step you won't want to miss.
	</p>

	<h2 class="header">Step 3: PRACTICE</h2>

	<p>Listening to this guided narration is a great way for you to get
		the hang of deep breathing and to be easily guided to a more relaxed
		state. As you become more familiar with the technique, you can use the
		panel to customize your practice with audio and visuals that appeal to
		you.</p>

	<p>You can also rate your stress levels both before and after
		practicing. The easy-to-use stress tracker records your scores in the
		dashboard so you can see your progress over time.</p>

	<p>Remember that practice makes perfect. Don't feel discouraged if
		you don't get this right the first time because it gets easier and
		more automatic the more often you do it. Deep belly breathing is a
		great way to reduce stress and you'll see increased benefits the
		longer you keep at it!</p>

	<h2 class="header">Step 4: TRACK</h2>

	<p>The TRACK feature lets you store all your ratings in a graph so
		you can compare your scores over time. This helps you figure out what
		things in your life are the most stressful, things like staff
		meetings, sleepless nights, or rush-hour traffic. By understanding
		what events trigger the most stress for you, you'll be better able to
		manage and reduce your stress head on with breathing exercises and
		self care.</p>

	<p>The TRACK feature also gives you a journal you can use to keep
		track of your thoughts and anything else you want to remember. Say
		you've found that a room in your house - the bedroom, maybe, or the
		den - is the place where it's easiest for you to relax and practice
		your breathing - or maybe you've noticed that it's easiest for you to
		practice your deep breathing exercises first thing after you wake up
		in the morning. You can jot these thoughts down in your journal so you
		can remember them later.</p>

	<p>You'll also find in the Track feature some great pointers for
		ways to improve and troubleshoot your breathing practice, as well as
		some general health and wellness tips.</p>
