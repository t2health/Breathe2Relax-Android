	<h1 class="header">“How To” Breathe</h1>
	<p>Now, to better understand how breathing affects your relaxation
		response, it helps to know a bit about the biology behind it.</p>

	<h2 class="header">The Diaphragm</h2>

	<p>Your lungs span from the top of your chest down to your
		diaphragm. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle under your lungs that
		rises and falls as you breathe. When you inhale deeply, the diaphragm
		presses down: your stomach pooches out and your lungs expand, pulling
		in air and oxygenating your blood. When you exhale, your diaphragm
		moves up, pressing air out of your lungs and releasing your belly so
		that it sinks in again.</p>

	<h2 class="header">Chest versus Diaphragmatic Breathing</h2>

	<p>Now, there are two main types of breathing: chest and
		diaphragmatic breathing. Chest breathing is shallow and rapid. It
		doesn’t fully expand your lungs, and starves your lower lobes of
		oxygen. When you breathe with your chest, there’s less oxygen in your
		blood and fewer nutrients to sustain your body. Your body then senses
		that the blood and tissues are in need of fuel and will continue in an
		activated state of stress until its needs are met.</p>

	<p>
		<em>Diaphragmatic</em>, or belly breathing, takes advantage of the
		full range of movement of your diaphragm. It’s how babies and children
		naturally breathe, and it’s probably how you breathe when you’re
		asleep or relaxed. Diaphragmatic breathing activates the relaxation
		response by supplying an excess of oxygen to the blood, which then
		‘tops off’ the oxygen and energy reserves in the body’s tissues. This
		creates a reserve of oxygen rich fuel for the body to draw upon, when
		needed, and contributes to balancing your emotions. As the body senses
		this energy reserve, it then begins to relax.

	<h2 class="header">Chest or Belly…How Do I Know?</h2>

	<p>For many of us, breathing with our chests is a habit, and it
		feels strange when we practice belly breathing and feel our stomachs
		rise and fall. But, here’s an easy way to start mastering belly
		breathing.</p>

	<p>First, find a quiet place where you know you won’t be disturbed.
		Lie down on your back on a flat surface. Put one hand on your upper
		chest and one on your belly, just below your rib cage. Close your eyes
		and breathe in slowly through your nose. You’ll feel the hand on your
		belly rise noticeably, while the hand on your chest will barely move.
		Then tighten up your stomach muscles and slowly exhale, allowing the
		air to gradually escape through your lips. The hand on your stomach
		will fall quite a bit, while the hand on your upper chest will hardly
		move.</p>

	<p>When you’re first learning how to belly breathe, you might find
		it easier to follow these instructions while lying down. You might
		also want to try putting a book on your belly: that way you can watch
		it rise and fall while you practice, letting you know that you’re
		breathing deeply with your diaphragm instead of shallowly with your
		chest. Pay attention to the flow of your breath. Strive to make it
		smooth and gentle. Try to find a steady rhythm in your breathing.</p>

	<p>As you become more comfortable with belly breathing, try doing
		it sitting up. Even if it’s hard at first, you’ll find that it will
		get easier and more automatic over time. Be patient. Although
		“breathing” sounds like it should be easy to do, diaphragmatic
		breathing takes practice. It is important that you feel comfortable
		with this type of breathing before you move onto the guided breathing
		exercise. When you’re ready you can move onto the diaphragmatic
		breathing exercise by selecting BREATHE from the main menu</p>
